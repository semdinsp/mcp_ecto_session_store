defmodule McpEctoSessionStore.JSONSafe do
  @moduledoc """
  Produce a JSON-safe copy of an MCP session-state map before it is written to a
  `jsonb` column.

  Anubis folds the whole request `conn.assigns` into the persisted session
  `frame`, so the state map an `Anubis.Server.Session.Store` is handed can carry
  values with **no `JSON.Encoder` implementation** — a request-scoped struct
  (e.g. a host's authenticated-user struct), a tuple, a pid, a ref, a function,
  a `MapSet`. Encoding such a map raises in the database driver, which — because
  it happens mid-`initialize` — would crash the session process and drop the
  connection.

  `sanitize/1` recursively drops anything non-encodable from its enclosing map
  or list while preserving encodable siblings:

    * a struct **with** a `JSON.Encoder` impl (`DateTime`, `Date`, `Decimal`,
      ...) is kept; a bare struct without one is dropped;
    * a map keeps only entries whose key is a valid JSON object key (binary or
      atom) **and** whose value survives sanitization;
    * a list keeps only its surviving elements.

  Keys are otherwise preserved as-is, so a string-keyed restore reads the same
  values back after the `jsonb` round-trip. The result always encodes cleanly.
  """

  # Out-of-band drop sentinel. A two-element module tuple is itself never a kept
  # (JSON-safe) value, so it cannot collide with a legitimate sanitized value the
  # way a bare atom sentinel could (a real `:__drop__` in the input would then be
  # wrongly filtered).
  @drop {__MODULE__, :__drop__}

  @doc """
  Return a JSON-encodable copy of `value`, dropping any non-encodable members.

  A top-level value that is itself non-encodable (and not a map or list to
  descend into) sanitizes to an empty map, so the return is always encodable.
